# DCIT 403 – Intelligent Agent Systems (Laboratory)

This repository provides the complete practical laboratory environment for the course **Intelligent Agent Systems (DCIT 403)**.

## Primary Practical Project
**Disaster Response & Relief Coordination System**

Students will design, implement, and evaluate a distributed multi-agent system using Python and SPADE.

## Technologies Used

- SPADE (Smart Python Agent Development Environment)
- XMPP (Prosody Server)
- GitHub Codespaces

## Weekly Lab Structure
Each lab builds incrementally toward the final project:
- Agent creation
- Perception modeling
- Reactive and deliberative behavior
- FIPA-ACL communication
- Coordination and task allocation
- System evaluation

## Getting Started
1. Click **Code → Open with Codespaces**
2. Wait for environment initialization
3. Navigate to `labs/lab01_setup`
4. Run:
